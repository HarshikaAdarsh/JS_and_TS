Javascript (default behaviour)

    1) synchronous
    2) single threaded

   - console log 1 
   - console log 2
   - call stack 



   --Blocking Code vs Non Blocking code

      Blocking Code - Block the flow of program 
                      hold everything if one task is not executed
                      Read file synchronously

      Non Blocking code - Does not Block execution
                          do not hold any task instead deligation of task is happening
                          Read file Asynchronously
